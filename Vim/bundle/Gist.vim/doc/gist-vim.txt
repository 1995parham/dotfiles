TIPS                                                           *gist-vim-tips*

If you set "g:gist_clip_command", gist.vim will copy the gist code with option
"-c".

  - Mac: >
    let g:gist_clip_command = 'pbcopy'
<
  - Linux: >
    let g:gist_clip_command = 'xclip -selection clipboard'
<
  - Others (cygwin?): >
    let g:gist_clip_command = 'putclip'
<
If you want to detect filetype from the filename: >

    let g:gist_detect_filetype = 1
<
If you want to open the browser after the post: >

    let g:gist_open_browser_after_post = 1
<
If you want to change the browser: >

    let g:gist_browser_command = 'w3m %URL%'
<
or: >

    let g:gist_browser_command = 'opera %URL% &'
<
On windows, this should work with your user settings.

If you want to show your private gists with ":Gist -l": >

    let g:gist_show_privates = 1
<
If you want to edit all files for gists containing more than one: >

    let g:gist_get_multiplefile = 1
<

If you want to update a gist, embed >

    GistID: xxxxx
>
in your local file, then call >

    :Gist
>

INSTALL                                                     *gist-vim-install*

Copy gist.vim to your plugin directory.

gist.vim will create a curl cookie-jar file in your runtimepath.

rtp:
  - plugin/gist.vim
  - cookies/github

If you want to uninstall gist.vim, remember to also remove "cookies/github".

==============================================================================
SETUP                                                       *gist-vim-setup*

This plugin uses github API v3. Setting value is stored in `~/.gist.vim`.
gist-vim have two ways to access APIs.

First, you need to set your Github username in global git config:
>
    $ git config --global github.user Username
<
Then, gist.vim will ask for your password to create an authorization when you
first use it.  The password is not stored and only the OAuth access token will
be kept for later use.  You can revoke the token at any time from the list of
"Authorized applications" on Github's "Account Settings" page.
(https://github.com/settings/applications)

If you happen to have your password already written in ~/.gitconfig like
below:
>
    [github]
        password = xxxxx
<
Then, add following into your ~/.vimrc
>
    let g:gist_use_password_in_gitconfig = 1
<
This is not secure at all, so strongly discouraged.
