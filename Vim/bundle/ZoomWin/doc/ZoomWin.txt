==============================================================================
1. Usage						*zoomwin-usage*

   :call ZoomWin()
   :ZoomWin
   <c-w>o

   Either of the two commands or the normal mode <c-w>o will toggle between
	* selecting the current window for display as the only window or
	* restoring the original multiple-window view.


==============================================================================
2. Setup						*zoomwin-setup*

   ZoomWin comes as a vimball; to install it, simply >

       vim ZoomWin.vba.gz
       :so %
       :q
<
   Your .vimrc needs to have, at least: >

   	set nocp
	filetype plugin on
<
   (see |'nocp'|, |:filetype|, and |filetype-plugin-on| for an explanation of
   these commands)

==============================================================================
3. Options						*zoomwin-options*

   *g:ZoomWin_funcref* : this variable is used as a function reference
			 (|Funcref|) or as a |List| of function references.
			 It is called with a single argument: >
			   0 : multi-window display; not zoomed in
			   1 : single-window display; zoomed in
<			 What this does is permits ZoomWin users to have a
			 function called whenever ZoomWin changes state.
			 As an example, consider having the status line
			 indicate whether one is ZoomWin'd in or not: >
			    set stl=Normal
			    fun! ZWStatline(state)
			      if a:state
			       set stl=ZoomWin
			      else
			       set stl=Normal
			      endif
			    endfun
			    if !exists("g:ZoomWin_funcref")
			     let g:ZoomWin_funcref= function("ZWStatline")
			    endif
<			 The function, ZWStatline(), is called by ZoomWin()
			 every time it changes state.

	*g:zoomwin_localoptlist*	specify a set of windows options to be
				saved and restored during zoom-in and zoom-out.
				It may be empty.
				Default:  >
				let s:localoptlist   = [
				\ "ai"  , "ar"  , "bh"  , "bin", "bl"  ,
				\ "bomb", "bt"  , "cfu" , "ci" , "cin" ,
				\ "cink", "cino", "cinw", "cms", "com" ,
				\ "cpt" , "efm" , "eol" , "ep" , "et"  ,
				\ "fenc", "fex" , "ff"  , "flp", "fo"  ,
				\ "ft"  , "gp"  , "imi" , "ims", "inde",
				\ "inex", "indk", "inf" , "isk", "key" ,
				\ "kmp" , "lisp", "mps" , "ml" , "ma"  ,
				\ "mod" , "nf"  , "ofu" , "oft", "pi"  ,
				\ "qe"  , "ro"  , "sw"  , "sn" , "si"  ,
				\ "sts" , "spc" , "spf" , "spl", "sua" ,
				\ "swf" , "smc" , "syn" , "ts" , "tx"  ,
				\ "tw"  , "udf" , "wm"]
<
	*g:zoomwin_preserve_taglist*	open and close a taglist window on
	                              zooms

	*g:zoomwin_preserve_winmanager*	open and close winmanager a window on
	                              zooms

4. History						*zoomwin-history*

	v25	Jul 30, 2012	: (Paul, google01239) ZoomWin wasn't saving the
				  local value of |'diff'|.  It has now been included
				  in the s:localoptlist (options which are local).
				* (Adam George) when clipboard=unnamed, ZoomWin
				  was overwriting the @* register.  Fixed.
		Oct 16, 2012	* (Marcin Szamotulski) reported that vim -o x y,
				  then zooming in and zooming back out resulted
				  in |:swapname| showing "No swap file".  Fixed.
		Oct 31, 2012	* (Adam George) reported that |E13| errors occurred
				* when one zoomed in, zoomed out, and then
				* attempted to write.  Fixed (due to [Scratch]
				* file renaming)
		Jan 14, 2013	* (Jorge Rodrigues) reported on errors in
				  RestoreUserSettings() associated with
				  saving and restoring the |'scrolloff'| setting.
				  ZoomWin now protects against that by testing
				  if the current vim supports |xterm-clipboard|.
		Mar 13, 2013	* (Ingo Karkat) provided patches for three
				  problems:
				  1) setting some options (like |'keymap'|) has
				  side effects; only restore an option if its
				  changed
				  2) |:windo| has side effect of changing the height
				  of every visited window from 0 to 1
				  3) matches are saved and restored (see
				 |getmatches()| and |setmatches()|)
				* buffers with bh=wipe were being wiped out during
				  zoom in and out. Fixed (cec)
		Jul 15, 2013	* (Ingo Karkat) ZoomWin now works with |i_CTRL-O|,
				  removes an |E481| when a count is used with
				  ZoomWin, and removed a superfluous <script>
				  modifier to the mapping.
		Nov 09, 2013	* (Saad Malik) reported that ZoomWin+MiniBufExpl
				  caused the latter's window to expand after a
				  zoom-in/out.  techlivezheng provided a fix
				  to have s:localoptlist include |'wfh'| and
				  |'wfw'|.
		Feb 19, 2014	* (Daniel Hahler) ZoomWin needs to save and
				  restore |'shm'|, setting it to shm+=A to
				  avoid "ATTENTION" messages when an existing
				  swap file is involved.
		Mar 09, 2014	* (Adam George) reported that the @* register
				  problem was still present with MacOS (see
				  Rodriguez, above).  Wrong clipboard test
				  was used; fixed.
	v24	Jan 29, 2009	: |g:ZoomWin_funcref| supported
		May 22, 2009	* supports the saving and restoring of window
				  variables across zooms
		Oct 11, 2009	* The state wasn't being passed along to
				  g:ZoomWin_funcref as intended.  Fixed.
		Jul 09, 2010	* Put an exists() test into s:RestoreWinVars()
		Jan 18, 2011	* (reported by talek) bypass winfixheight option
		Apr 06, 2011	* Saves and restores local options for every window
	v23	Apr 24, 2008	: when |'scrollbind'| was activated: when ZoomWin
				  attempted to restore multiple-windows, the cursor
				  position was incorrect.  Fixed.
		Jan 02, 2009	* included some more things in the session file
				* broke ZoomWin into an plugin + autoload pair
				* (Ingo Karkat) contributed a patch to retain the
				  the search pattern before zooming
				* (Ingo Karkat) contributed a patch to detect the
				  vim 7.2 name for the command line window
				* too many files (more than the screen rows)
				  caused restoration problems.
	v22	Apr 10, 2006	: "only" was occasionally issuing an "Already one
				  window" message, which is now prevented
				* SavePosn() issued error message when handling an
				  empty buffer
				* saves yank registers and restores them on each
				  zoom/unzoom
	v21	Oct 12, 2004	: v14 fixed a bug when wmw and/or wmv equal to 0;
				  v21 will invoke the patch only if the version <= 603.
				  For vim version 6.3 users, this fix allows more files
				  to be handled by ZoomWin.
		May 10, 2005	* When :version shows -mksession, and the vim version
				  is at least 6.3, ZoomWin will now do a partial zoom
	v20	Jul 26, 2004	: bugfix - ZoomWin didn't always retain the
				  position in the former zoomed-in window after
				  the window layout was restored.  It was restoring
				  the position when the zoom-in occurred.
	v19	May 26, 2004	: bugfix - winmanager has events firing that,
				  amongst other things, reset the bufhidden
				  option to delete for some windows while
				  ZoomWin worked.  ZoomWin now works
				  successfully with winmanager.
	v18	May 20, 2004	: bugfix - didn't adversely affect anything, but
				  ZoomWin was deleting its session file twice.
				  * bugfix -- a multi-source file + minibufexplorer
				  + Taglist interaction bug -- minibufexplorer's
				  autocmd events were firing, generating a new
				  window while ZoomWin was attempting to restore
				  the display.  ZoomWin didn't have restoration
				  information for the new window and so reported
				  an error.  Events are now temporarily disabled
				  while ZoomWin is restoring the layout.
	v17	Mar 26, 2004	: ZoomWin command installed.  Works nicely with
				  taglist:  vim +Tlist +ZoomWin filename
	v16	Dec 22, 2003	: handles bufhidden and nobl windows (TagList support).
				  * Now also works with quickfix window (:copen) but
				  still not with |cmdline-window| (q:)
	v15	Dec 19, 2003	: SavePosn()/RestorePosn() needed to be preceded
				  by s: to prevent clashes
	v14	Dec 18, 2003	: works around a restoration-bug with mksession
				  when either wmw or wmh settings are zero
				  * Bwipes internal temporary buffers
				  * Known bugs: will not work with command-line
				  * Editing window (|cmdline-window|) nor the
				  quickfix window (|copen|).
	v13	Dec 18, 2003	: Uses eventignore to prevent events/autocmds from
				  firing while changing the mksession results.
	v12	Dec 12, 2003	: uses hidden and a minimalist mksession save
	v11	Oct 14, 2003	: bug fix: apparently RestorePosn()'s variables,
				  which were b:, weren't always defined, so s:
				  ones are now used.
	v10	Sep 22, 2003	: Bug fix: when a single window is showing, the user
				  moves the cursor, then <c-w>o used to restore
				  screen, the current cursor position wasn't retained
				  Restores v:this_session.
				  Bug fix: change a window, use <c-w>o, then write.
				  Was saving file only to temporary file instead of
				  actual file, but when the actual file was brought back,
				  the changes were lost.
	v9	Aug 15, 2003	:  v8 managed to trash syntax highlighting on
				  reload, this one removes the eventignore
				  handling.  Will need more pondering...
	v8	Aug 14, 2003	:  now handles not-modified but not filereadable
				  buffers, nowrite buffers uses eventignore to
				  bypass autocmd firing
	v7	May 23, 2003	:  bugfix - GotoWinNum() didn't always get the
				  cursor into the correct window
	v6	Mar 25, 2003	:  more cleanup included
	v5	Mar 14, 2003	:  includes support for handling scratch buffers,
				  no-name buffer windows, and modified-buffer
				  windows.  All windows' contents will be saved to
				  temporary buffers
	v4	Dec 12, 2002	:  Zak Beck contributed code to clean up temporary
				  session files if one leaves vim while zoomed-in
	v3	Dec 11, 2002	:  plugin-ized
	v2	Nov 08, 2002	:  A guaranteed-to-be-unique to this
				  session file is used for session information.
				  Modified but not yet saved files are made hidden
				  during zoom in.
