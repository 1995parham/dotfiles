This repository contains my personal configurations for ubuntu, manjaro (with i3 window manager), apple osx and even windows 10, which was created in Fall 2013 when I was a lonely BSc' student at the Amirkabir University of Technology.
First of all, thank you for your visiting, to find out more about how to use this configuration with neovim, oh-my-zsh, etc. please check the following sections.
Special thanks to [@elahe-dastan](https://github.com/elahe-dastan) for using this project and reporting its issues. Her unique contribution to this repository and my life is unforgettable.
