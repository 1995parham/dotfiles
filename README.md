## Introduction
My Personal Linux, OSx configurations files since 2013 :)
## Installation
For using this configuration files you can install them with
```sh
python3 install.py
```
## How to ....
### Dircolors on OSx
Try installing the GNU coreutils from this if you really want dircolors to work.
I also had to set an alias for dircolors to gdircolors as this is the command that FreeBSD ports installed the fun as.
### Font
Personally I used *Meslo LG S Powerline* as my default font and you can
install it with
```sh
./fonts/install.sh
```
