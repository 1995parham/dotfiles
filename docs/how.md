## Build Router and NAT with your ubuntu

First edit `/etc/sysctl.conf` and uncomment:

```
# net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```

so that it reads:

```
net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```

To enable IP masquerading, enter following set of commands in terminal:

```sh
# eth0: LAN - private
# eth1: WAN - public

sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth1 -j MASQUERADE

sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i eth1 -o eth0 -m state -â€“state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o eth1 -j ACCEPT
```

> IP Masquerade is a form of Network Address Translation or NAT which NAT allows internally connected computers that do not have one or more registered Internet IP addresses to communicate to the Internet via the Linux server's Internet IP address.

## Better bash on CentOS

For having better bash completion use following package:

```sh
yum install bash-completion
```

## Dircolors on OSx

Try installing the GNU coreutils from this if you really want dircolors to work.
I also had to set an alias for dircolors to gdircolors as this is the command that FreeBSD ports installed the fun as.

```sh
brew install coreutils
ln -s /usr/local/bin/gdircolors /usr/local/bin/dircolors
ln -s /usr/local/bin/gls /usr/local/bin/ls
```

## Font

Personally I used *Meslo LG S Powerline* as my default font and you can
install it with

```sh
./fonts/install.sh
```

## Airspeed [Automated ...]

For installing *airspeed* on OSx use pip3 command as follows

```sh
pip3 install airspeed
```

For installing it on Ubuntu you must compile it from source code:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/purcell/airspeed.git
cd airspeed
sudo python3 setup.py install
cd ..
sudo rm -Rf airspeed
```

## Ubuntu Bug

sudo -s
echo "disable" > /sys/firmware/acpi/interrupts/gpe13
```

## ONOS Configuration

autoload bashcompinit
bashcompinit
source $ONOS_ROOT/tools/dev/bash_profile
```

and comment out following line in `$ONOS_ROOT/tools/dev/bash_profile`:

```sh
export ONOS_CELL=${ONOS_CELL:-local}
```

## GTK Theme Settings

## Tell ubuntu do nothing when laptop lid is closed

1. Open the `/etc/systemd/logind.conf` file in a text editor as root, for example,

2. Add a line `HandleLidSwitch=ignore` (make sure it's not commented out!)
3. Restart the systemd daemon with this command:

```sh
sudo service systemd-logind restart
