## Install Go on Ubuntu [Automated]

```sh
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gophers/archive
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt-get install golang-1.9-go
```

Note that golang-1.9-go puts binaries in /usr/lib/go-1.9/bin. If you want them on your PATH, you need to make that change yourself.

```sh
$ sudo ln -s /usr/lib/go-1.9/bin/go /usr/bin/go
$ sudo ln -s /usr/lib/go-1.9/bin/gofmt /usr/bin/gofmt
```

## Build Router and NAT with your ubuntu

First edit `/etc/sysctl.conf` and uncomment:

```
# net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```

so that it reads:

```
net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```

To enable IP masquerading, enter following set of commands in terminal:

```sh
# eth0: LAN - private
# eth1: WAN - public

sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth1 -j MASQUERADE

sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i eth1 -o eth0 -m state -â€“state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o eth1 -j ACCEPT
```

> IP Masquerade is a form of Network Address Translation or NAT which NAT allows internally connected computers that do not have one or more registered Internet IP addresses to communicate to the Internet via the Linux server's Internet IP address.
