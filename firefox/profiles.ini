# Firefox Profiles Configuration - REFERENCE ONLY
#
# NOTE: This file is NOT copied to your Firefox installation anymore.
# The firefox.sh script now uses 'firefox -CreateProfile' to create profiles
# with the correct InstallHash automatically.
#
# This file serves as documentation of the expected profile structure.
# The actual profiles.ini is generated by Firefox with the correct InstallHash
# for your specific Firefox installation.
#
# Profile structure created by firefox.sh:
# - Profile 1 (main): Default profile for parham.alvani@gmail.com
# - Profile 2 (personal): Secondary profile for 1995parham@gmail.com

# The [InstallXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX] section is generated dynamically by Firefox
# based on your installation path - it CANNOT be hardcoded across systems.
# Example:
# [Install2656FF1E876E9973]
# Default=main.default
# Locked=1
