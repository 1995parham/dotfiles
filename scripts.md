# Scripts

These are applications that I use in a daily manner, so I created a nice and easy way to install them.

## Package Managers

The following operating systems and their package managers are supported:

- Archlinux:
  - [Pacman](https://archlinux.org/pacman/)
  - [Yet another Yogurt](https://github.com/Jguer/yay)
- OSx
  - [Brew](https://brew.sh)

## Applications

For each package, I mentioned its *script*:
